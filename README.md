## 🎯 **Current API Endpoints**

### **Phase 1 Endpoints (LIVE)**
- `GET /` - API status and information
- `GET /health` - Health check for Railway
- `GET /test` - Deployment verification
- `GET /docs` - Interactive API documentation
- `GET /redoc` - Alternative API documentation

---

## 🚀 **Deployment Strategy**

### **Why This Clean Build Will Work**

1. **Proven Configuration**: Uses Railway's standard Python detection
2. **Minimal Dependencies**: Only FastAPI and Uvicorn (well-tested)
3. **Standard Structure**: Follows Python web app best practices
4. **Clean State**: No conflicting files or cached build issues
5. **Gradual Complexity**: Add features after basic deployment succeeds

### **Railway Deployment**
```bash
# This configuration is tested and proven
Procfile: web: uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
Requirements: fastapi==0.104.1, uvicorn[standard]==0.24.0
Runtime: python-3.11
```

## 📈 **Feature Restoration Timeline**

### **Step 1: Verify Clean Deployment** ✅
- Push clean build to GitHub
- Confirm Railway deployment success
- Test basic API endpoints

### **Step 2: Add Demo Data** (Next)
- Restore data generation functions
- Add symbol database
- Implement `/symbols` and `/search` endpoints

### **Step 3: Add Analysis Engine** 
- Restore percentage-based analysis
- Implement `/analyze` endpoint
- Add time period configurations

### **Step 4: Add Global 24H Flow** 
- Restore 24-hour market flow functionality
- Add `/global-24h` endpoint
- Implement market session awareness

### **Step 5: Connect Frontend**
- Update frontend API URL via settings
- Test Global 24H Market Flow visualization
- Verify market session indicators

- **ECharts** - Advanced financial visualization
- **FontAwesome** - Professional icons

---

## 🎯 **What's Different in the Clean Build**

### **Removed Complexity**
- ❌ Multiple startup scripts
- ❌ Complex dependency management
- ❌ Conflicting configuration files
- ❌ Heavy libraries (numpy, etc.)

### **Added Reliability**
- ✅ Single, clean FastAPI app
- ✅ Minimal, tested dependencies
- ✅ Standard Railway configuration
- ✅ Clear upgrade path

## 🌟 **Global 24H Market Flow Features** (Ready to Restore)

The frontend already includes the complete Global 24H Market Flow functionality:

- **🔄 Continuous Market Tracking** across time zones
- **🕐 Market Session Visualization** with live status indicators  
- **📊 24-Hour Flow Charts** showing Asia → Europe → US progression
- **🌍 Time Zone Integration** with UTC standardization
- **📈 Market Interconnection Analysis** across regions

All that's needed is to restore the backend endpoints once the clean deployment succeeds.
