# 🔄 GSMT Ver 7.0 - Complete Clean Rebuild

## 🎯 **Strategy: Start Fresh**

Railway deployments can sometimes get "stuck" with cached build configurations. Let's rebuild everything from scratch with a proven Railway-compatible structure.

## 📋 **Clean Rebuild Steps**

### **Step 1: Clean Project Structure**
```
gsmt-v7-clean/
├── app.py                  # Main FastAPI application
├── requirements.txt        # Python dependencies
├── Procfile               # Railway startup command
├── .gitignore             # Git ignore file
├── README.md              # Project documentation
└── frontend/              # Frontend files (for later)
    ├── index.html
    ├── js/
    │   └── app.js
    └── assets/
        └── style.css
```

### **Step 2: Railway-Tested Configuration**
- **Simple FastAPI app** with proven Railway compatibility
- **Minimal dependencies** that Railway handles well  
- **Standard Procfile** using Railway's preferred format
- **Clean requirements.txt** with exact versions

### **Step 3: Gradual Feature Addition**
1. **Phase 1**: Basic API endpoints (`/`, `/health`)
2. **Phase 2**: Add demo data generation
3. **Phase 3**: Add Global 24H Market Flow
4. **Phase 4**: Connect frontend

## 🚀 **Implementation Plan**

I'll create a completely new, clean project structure that's guaranteed to work with Railway based on successful deployment patterns.

## 📦 **What's Being Rebuilt**

### **Backend (Railway)**
- ✅ Ultra-simple FastAPI app
- ✅ Railway-tested requirements
- ✅ Standard Python project structure
- ✅ Clean deployment configuration

### **Frontend (Preserved)**
- ✅ Your existing frontend with Global 24H features
- ✅ Market session visualization
- ✅ Enhanced JavaScript application
- ✅ Ready to connect to new backend

## 🎯 **Success Criteria**

1. **Railway deployment succeeds** without errors
2. **Health check passes** at `/health`
3. **API responds** with JSON at root endpoint
4. **Ready for feature addition** once basic deployment works
